1) What Is Javascript Objects?
    Answer :
    JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides four basic capabilities to developers-

        Encapsulation: the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.
        Aggregation: the capability to store one object inside another object.
        Inheritance: the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.
        Polymorphism: the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.

    Objects are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property.
