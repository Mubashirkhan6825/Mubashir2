Q5. Difference between Var let const (with example)?
Ans.
    Var are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. 
    var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope, let variables can be updated but not    re-declared, const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.

     var ex-
            var x = 5;
            var y = 6;
            var z = x + y;
        
     let ex- 
    
    
            let x = 5;
            let y = 6;
            let z = x + y;
        
     const ex-
    
            const price1 = 5;
            const price2 = 6;
            let total = price1 + price2;
