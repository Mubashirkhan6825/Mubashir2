Q14. Explain Promise with example?
Ans. 
In JavaScript, a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not.
A promise may have one of three states.
Pending
Fulfilled
Rejected
A promise starts in a pending state. That means the process is not complete. If the operation is successful, the process ends in a fulfilled state. And, if an error occurs, the process ends in a rejected state.
For example, when you request data from the server by using a promise, it will be in a pending state. When the data arrives successfully, it will be in a fulfilled state. If an error occurs, then it will be in a rejected state.

    <body>
        <script>
            let count = true;
 
            let countValue = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
                if (count) {
                    resolve("There is a count value.");
                } else {
                    reject("There is no count value");
                }
            });
            
            console.log(countValue);
        </script>
