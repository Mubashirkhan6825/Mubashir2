Q12. Explain map with example ?
Ans. JavaScript Map:
    Map is similar to objects in JavaScript that allows us to store elements in a key/value pair.
    The elements in a Map are inserted in an insertion order. However, unlike an object, a map can contain objects, functions and other data types as key.

    Create JavaScript Map:
    To create a Map, we use the new Map() constructor. 
    For example,
    <html>
        <body>
            <script>
                
                let map1 = new Map();
                map1.set('info', {name: 'Jack', age: 26});
                console.log(map1);
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
