Q11. What are the Modules in ES6 with example?
Ans.
ES6 Modules:
    An ES6 module is a JavaScript file that executes in strict mode only. It means that any variables or functions declared in the module wonâ€™t be added automatically to the global scope.
A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

Modules can load each other and use special directives export and import to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

export keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
import allows the import of functionality from other modules.
